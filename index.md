# Smart Mirror
The smart mirror is a mirror where you can not only look at yourself but have it display different information on the screen such as the date, time, weather, to-do lists, or even have it play music! A monitor, which is run by Raspberry Pi sits behind the mirror and enables information to be displayed onto the screen. I used React to program and customize information on the mirror.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi and getting the base project working. To set up the Raspberry Pi, I had download the Raspbian Software and work with and connect different components like a mouse, keyboard, and SD card to the monitor. I also set up SSH and VNC in order to be able to view everything on the same screen. After setting up the Raspberry Pi, I moved onto installing the Smart Mirror software from a gitHub respository created by my instructor along with installing node.js and npm. Now with the first milestone completed, I can move onto coding and adding modifications.
